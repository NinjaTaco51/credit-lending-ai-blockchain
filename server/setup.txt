1. Install dependencies in server folder:
    cd server
    npm install mongoose

2. Set up MongoDB:
    - Create a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas
    - Create a database named 'creditview' (or any name you like)
    - Get your connection string from Atlas

3. Create server/.env file:
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/creditview?retryWrites=true&w=majority

4. Create client/.env.local file:
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

5. Run CreditModel
    cd creditmodel
    python -m venv .venv

    # Open VM **
    source venv/bin/activate      # (Linux/Mac)
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # (Windows)

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run the model **
    python ./server/model.py

    # Run the application
    python server/server.py

6. Start the server:
    cd server
    node server.js

7. Start the Next.js client:
    cd client
    npm run dev

8. The "loanrequests" collection (backed by the LoanRequest Mongoose model)
    will be created automatically in MongoDB when the first loan request is saved.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The lender dashboard fetches from: http://localhost:3000/api/loan-requests
- The borrower loan form submits to: http://localhost:3000/api/loan-requests
- Borrower credit data still comes from Supabase
- Loan requests are stored in MongoDB via Mongoose
